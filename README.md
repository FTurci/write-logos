# Write Logos in  Python

Write to SVG with a custom font.

There are two programs that are useful at this stage in the folder `src`

- `produce.py` which combines two given fonts to generate a logo
- `writer.py` which generates a random selection of logos


In the folder `tkinterapp` there is a script for a user-friendly GUI to retrieve random logos locally from Github.
